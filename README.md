IPL Match Outcome Prediction
A machine learning project to predict the outcome of IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches using historical data, advanced feature engineering, and classification algorithms.
🏏 Project Overview
This project implements a complete data science pipeline to predict IPL match outcomes with the following key features:

Data Processing Pipeline: Automated data cleaning and preprocessing
Advanced Feature Engineering: Historical performance, venue statistics, toss impact analysis
Multiple ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
Cross-Validation: Robust model evaluation with stratified k-fold validation
Performance Metrics: Comprehensive evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

📊 Dataset Requirements
This project works with IPL match datasets that contain the following columns:
Required Columns:

team1: First team name
team2: Second team name
winner: Match winner
venue: Match venue
city: Host city
toss_winner: Toss winner
toss_decision: Toss decision (bat/field)

Optional Columns:

date: Match date (for temporal features)
id: Match ID (for chronological ordering)
result: Match result type (normal/tie/no result)

Compatible Datasets:

Kaggle IPL Dataset: IPL Complete Dataset (2008-2020)
IPL Data from 2008-2024: Available on various cricket data repositories
Custom IPL datasets: Any CSV file with the required column structure
